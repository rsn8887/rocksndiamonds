===============================================================================
Compiling and installing Rocks'n'Diamonds
===============================================================================

To compile the game, you either need the new SDL2 library (recommended) or the
old SDL 1.2 library. In addition, you also need the libraries SDL_image,
SDL_mixer (including the SMPEG library if you want MP3 support) and SDL_net.

Please install these libraries before building Rocks'n'Diamonds.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux and other Unix systems (including Mac OS X):
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just run "make" to build the game using either SDL2 or SDL (whatever being
available).

Run "make sdl" or "make sdl2" to explicitly use either SDL 1.2 or SDL2.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows with gcc (native or cross-compiling)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build the game natively, just proceed as described above for Unix systems.

To cross-compile the game for Windows, run "cross-win32". You probably have to
adjust the path to the Windows cross-compiler defined in "CROSS_PATH_WIN32" in
the top-level Makefile.


That's all!

If you have any comments, corrections or suggestions regarding the Makefiles,
please let me know at "info@artsoft.org". Thanks!

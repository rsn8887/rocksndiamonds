Dynabombs are an infinite supply of bombs that the player can drop at any time
he doesn't have anything else to drop. They explode in a cross shaped pattern,
and may have strange results when they kill enemies. (For example, Yam Yams
will only give off the center element of their pattern.)

This pick-up will increase the number of Dynabombs the player can put on the
field at one time. This number starts at zero, so the player must pick up one
of these to use Dynabombs.

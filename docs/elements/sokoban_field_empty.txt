This is an empty sokoban field. Only the player and sokoban objects can pass
onto these fields. Watch out, the fields will be destroyed by explosions!

Note that spare fields will prevent the exit from opening, but spare objects
won't. Also, sometimes it is necessary to push sokoban objects off of fields
to make room for other things.

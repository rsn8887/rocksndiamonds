The BD style amoeba has some special properties: When it is completely
surrounded, it instantly turns into the specified content. But if this
cannot be achieved in a certain amount of time, this amoeba instantly
turns to BD boulders instead. BD amoeba is the only amoeba that can be
smothered by the player.

All amoeba types must share the same settings.

Penguins follow the player as best they can. If they are next to an open exit,
they will leave the level. All the penguins *must* exit before the player
exits, or the player will not win the level. If a penguin is smashed, it'll
produce one purple gem, but the level will then be unsolvable. Penguins can
collect gems for the player.

Pressing this switch in a certain direction will cause all balloons and custom
elements that react on wind in this level to constantly move in that direction
if possible until another wind switch is pressed.

The balloons may still be pushed in any direction, including against their
automatic movement direction, but they will try to move in the appropriate
wind direction whenever they can.

This is a (EM style) magic wall. It gets activated for a limited
time by rocks or gems that fall on it. Objects falling though
it will be changed to other objects. After it has stopped running,
it cannot be activated again.

The duration is expressed in seconds. A duration of zero will let the wall
run forever. All regular magic walls run together; however, BD style magic
walls have a separate counter.

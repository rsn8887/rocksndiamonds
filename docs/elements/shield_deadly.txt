This not only makes the player invincible, but also allows him to kill enemies
just by pressing against them.

Extra deadly shields will add more time without wasting any time already
acquired. Picking up a deadly shield when you already have a normal shield
(or vice versa) will not waste the normal shield; the player will use the
normal shield when the deadly shield runs out.

Activating the magic wheel attracts the robots for a short time and
keeps them away from the player. When it stops running, the robots
will again turn towards the player.

The magic wheel can be activated again after it stopped running.
You can also activate other magic wheels while one is spinning;
the robots will go towards the latest active wheel.

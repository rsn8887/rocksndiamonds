This is regular amoeba. If, when it attempt to grow, it is blocked in all
directions by something other than the player, it will die. Amoeba will kill
any bugs, flies, or spaceships that touch it.

The amoeba growth value is the same for all types of amoeba.
Amoeba will take between 0 and [25/(1-value)] seconds to attempt to grow.

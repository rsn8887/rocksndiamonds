The fearsome dragon is completely harmless to the player; even their firey
breath won't faze him. Dragons wander about aimlessly and will breathe fire
if they aren't trapped, producing effects similar to explosions. Getting them
to do something useful can be quite a challenge in a space bigger than 4 or 5
squares.

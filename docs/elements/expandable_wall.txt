This wall will grow on either side that is open. It will stop
growing on one side if it is blocked by a wall, even if said wall is later
destroyed. Gems and others, however, will stop it only temporarily.

This particular growing wall is the only one that is visibly different
to the player from a normal wall, at least under the default graphics.

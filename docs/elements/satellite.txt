Satellites will follow the player as best they can, and the only way to outrun
them is with double speed. Satellites are harmless, and they can be pushed,
but in multiples or with strategically placed walls, they can easily trap the
player. When crushed or caught in an explosion, satellites will explode.

Satellites can be used as a sort of moving platform when gravity is on.

These walls behave like the well-known "Conway's Game of Life".
They behave like normal walls; however, they may appear or disappear
every half-second according to these rules:

Cells that are surrounded by 2 or 3 cells are the only cells that survive.

Space or dirt that is surrounded by exactly 3 cells grows into new cells.

The player(s) is (are) counted as cells!

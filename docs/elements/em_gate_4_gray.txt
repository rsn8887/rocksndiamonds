Emerald Mine doors will fling you to the other side of the door, rather than
letting you stand on it. If there is *any* object on the other side, the
player cannot pass through the door. Note that creators may allow players to
pass to anything walkable under the player object's options.

Gray doors' real colors are kept hidden to the player, making him/her guess
which color key opens the door.

This is a (BD style) magic wall. It gets activated for about 10 seconds by
rocks or gems that fall on it. Rocks that fall through it become BD style
diamonds, and gems that fall through it become BD style rocks. After it has
stopped running, it cannot be activated again.

All BD magic walls run on the same timer; however, regular magic walls run
on a seperate timer.
